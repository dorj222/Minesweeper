# Minesweeper
This is the implementation of a Minesweeper game, and I created this project when I took Mobile Software Development class that was taught by Dr. PÃ‰TER EKLER. This project is created on Android Studio along with Kotlin programming language. In this project, I used one main Activity, and one class that is in charge of game mechanics.
